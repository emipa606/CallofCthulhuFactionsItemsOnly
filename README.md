Update of Jecrells mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1091340782

- This is an unofficial port
- This will be removed when/if Jecrell comes back
- Added support for Combat Extended
- Replaced Jecs Tools for [Enable Oversized Weapons](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2543371889). Game version 1.2 and older will still use Jecs but the Mod-Manager will show a warning about it.

# Adds apparel and weapons from the Call of Cthulhu mod series, without the factions.


While the lingering fear of Cthulhu is most unnerving, you have chosen to not include the fabled factions in your game. So instead, these are simply their equipment -- available to you to do with as you will.
